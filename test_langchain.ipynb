Shades of green reflect highly seasonal continental climates ranging from bright green and petrol for cool boreal to warmer chartreuse colored regions; yellow reflects hot and arid conditions; pink reflects hot and wet tropical conditions, and purple represents wet oceanic environments.Alex Egoshin, www.vividmaps.comRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nAlex Egoshin, www.vividmaps.comRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nBest thing about living in North Dakota: Very slim chance of being struck by lightning!\\nI can‚Äôt seem to get to Sydney‚Äôs info üôÅ\\nTrending now\\nRelated Products\\nPush pin maps ¬∑ Globe drinks cabinets ¬∑ Maps of the United States\\xa0¬∑ Board games ¬∑ Monopoly ¬∑ Map-based strategy board games ¬∑ History Board Games ¬∑ Coloring Books ¬∑ Handheld GPS ¬∑ GPS Watches ¬∑ GPS Trackers\\nVivid Maps Tools\\n‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How hot cities could be in 2050‚Äì The U.S. Population Lines‚Äì Convert Latitude/Longitude‚Äì About‚Äì Privacy Policy\\n‚Äì About‚Äì Privacy Policy\\n'}], 'response_time': 3.26}), ToolMessage(content='[{\"url\": \"https://www.weatherapi.com/\", \"content\": \"{\\'location\\': {\\'name\\': \\'Los Angeles\\', \\'region\\': \\'California\\', \\'country\\': \\'United States of America\\', \\'lat\\': 34.0522, \\'lon\\': -118.2428, \\'tz_id\\': \\'America/Los_Angeles\\', \\'localtime_epoch\\': 1733859395, \\'localtime\\': \\'2024-12-10 11:36\\'}, \\'current\\': {\\'last_updated_epoch\\': 1733859000, \\'last_updated\\': \\'2024-12-10 11:30\\', \\'temp_c\\': 20.6, \\'temp_f\\': 69.1, \\'is_day\\': 1, \\'condition\\': {\\'text\\': \\'Sunny\\', \\'icon\\': \\'//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/113.png\\', \\'code\\': 1000}, \\'wind_mph\\': 3.1, \\'wind_kph\\': 5.0, \\'wind_degree\\': 17, \\'wind_dir\\': \\'NNE\\', \\'pressure_mb\\': 1026.0, \\'pressure_in\\': 30.31, \\'precip_mm\\': 0.0, \\'precip_in\\': 0.0, \\'humidity\\': 19, \\'cloud\\': 0, \\'feelslike_c\\': 20.6, \\'feelslike_f\\': 69.1, \\'windchill_c\\': 18.1, \\'windchill_f\\': 64.5, \\'heatindex_c\\': 18.3, \\'heatindex_f\\': 65.0, \\'dewpoint_c\\': -11.8, \\'dewpoint_f\\': 10.8, \\'vis_km\\': 16.0, \\'vis_miles\\': 9.0, \\'uv\\': 5.0, \\'gust_mph\\': 3.6, \\'gust_kph\\': 5.9}}\"}, {\"url\": \"https://weatherspark.com/h/m/1705/2024/10/Historical-Weather-in-October-2024-in-Los-Angeles-California-United-States\", \"content\": \"Los Angeles October 2024 Historical Weather Data (California, United States) - Weather Spark October 2024 Weather History in Los Angeles California, United States This report shows the past weather for Los Angeles, providing a weather history for October 2024.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA.

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90\" of snowfall per year. Juneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate.', 'score': 0.6202192, 'raw_content': \"The 10 Most Humid Cities in the U.S., Ranked\\nReading Time:  9 minutes\\nWeather can define a region and its identity. For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Last winter it was colder than the warmest parts of Antarctica in June!\\nWe‚Äôre talking climate, not weather.\\nhttps://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/weather_climate.html\\nWould be nice to filter by country. I‚Äôm looking at a city in the USA and half the cities with similar climates are other US cities in the same region. I‚Äôm more curious about cities in other countries.\\nthank you for providing this tool for free!!!! very interesting!\\nSydney is nothing like Pueblo Mexico. Completely wrong and arbitrary.\\nIt would be handy if the similar cities were listed by continent, so you could easily see cites far away that have a similar climate. Also the Koppen classification would be nice'}, {'title': 'Find cities with similar climate - Vivid Maps', 'url': 'https://vividmaps.com/find-cities-with-similar-climate/', 'content': 'Comparison of the climate of cities in the world. www.vividmaps.com.

Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere over a short period of time, while Climate refers to the conditions of the atmosphere over a long period of time.\\nWeather, more specifically, refers to how the atmosphere behaves and its effects on life and human activities. Most people think of Weather in terms of what can be observed: temperature, humidity, precipitation, and cloudy/sunny conditions. Weather conditions constantly change on a minute-to-minute basis.\\nClimate is a record of the average weather conditions for a given place over a long period of time, often referred to as Climate Normals.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA. We analyzed data for 251 cities throughout the United States. We used data on the average annual humidity data for mornings, using the most recent 2021 and 2022 data. This annual average data accounts for changes in months and seasons.\\nSam Wasson\\nStaff Writer\\nLearn More\\nLora Novak\\nSenior Editor\\nLearn More\\nBest Moving Labor Services\\nMay 12, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Massachusetts\\nOctober 18, 2024\\nThe Best U.S. Cities for Homeowners in 2022 & 2024\\nNovember 14, 2024\\nHow to Donate Your Used Items to Shelters\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nWhich States Will Pay You to Move There?\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBellhop Moving: An In-Depth Review of Services and Costs\\nNovember 19, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Florida\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n5 Cheap Ways to Ship a Car Cross-Country\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBest International Movers\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\n(251) 478-3345\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\nAdvertiser Disclosure\\nOur editorial team is committed to creating independent and objective content focused on helping our readers make informed decisions.

Juneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate.', 'score': 0.6202192, 'raw_content': \"The 10 Most Humid Cities in the U.S., Ranked\\nReading Time:  9 minutes\\nWeather can define a region and its identity. For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA. We analyzed data for 251 cities throughout the United States. We used data on the average annual humidity data for mornings, using the most recent 2021 and 2022 data. This annual average data accounts for changes in months and seasons.\\nSam Wasson\\nStaff Writer\\nLearn More\\nLora Novak\\nSenior Editor\\nLearn More\\nBest Moving Labor Services\\nMay 12, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Massachusetts\\nOctober 18, 2024\\nThe Best U.S. Cities for Homeowners in 2022 & 2024\\nNovember 14, 2024\\nHow to Donate Your Used Items to Shelters\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nWhich States Will Pay You to Move There?\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBellhop Moving: An In-Depth Review of Services and Costs\\nNovember 19, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Florida\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n5 Cheap Ways to Ship a Car Cross-Country\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBest International Movers\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\n(251) 478-3345\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\nAdvertiser Disclosure\\nOur editorial team is committed to creating independent and objective content focused on helping our readers make informed decisions.

For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Shades of green reflect highly seasonal continental climates ranging from bright green and petrol for cool boreal to warmer chartreuse colored regions; yellow reflects hot and arid conditions; pink reflects hot and wet tropical conditions, and purple represents wet oceanic environments.Alex Egoshin, www.vividmaps.comRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nAlex Egoshin, www.vividmaps.comRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nBest thing about living in North Dakota: Very slim chance of being struck by lightning!\\nI can‚Äôt seem to get to Sydney‚Äôs info üôÅ\\nTrending now\\nRelated Products\\nPush pin maps ¬∑ Globe drinks cabinets ¬∑ Maps of the United States\\xa0¬∑ Board games ¬∑ Monopoly ¬∑ Map-based strategy board games ¬∑ History Board Games ¬∑ Coloring Books ¬∑ Handheld GPS ¬∑ GPS Watches ¬∑ GPS Trackers\\nVivid Maps Tools\\n‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How hot cities could be in 2050‚Äì The U.S. Population Lines‚Äì Convert Latitude/Longitude‚Äì About‚Äì Privacy Policy\\n‚Äì About‚Äì Privacy Policy\\n'}], 'response_time': 3.26}), ToolMessage(content='[{\"url\": \"https://www.weatherapi.com/\", \"content\": \"{\\'location\\': {\\'name\\': \\'Los Angeles\\', \\'region\\': \\'California\\', \\'country\\': \\'United States of America\\', \\'lat\\': 34.0522, \\'lon\\': -118.2428, \\'tz_id\\': \\'America/Los_Angeles\\', \\'localtime_epoch\\': 1733859395, \\'localtime\\': \\'2024-12-10 11:36\\'}, \\'current\\': {\\'last_updated_epoch\\': 1733859000, \\'last_updated\\': \\'2024-12-10 11:30\\', \\'temp_c\\': 20.6, \\'temp_f\\': 69.1, \\'is_day\\': 1, \\'condition\\': {\\'text\\': \\'Sunny\\', \\'icon\\': \\'//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/113.png\\', \\'code\\': 1000}, \\'wind_mph\\': 3.1, \\'wind_kph\\': 5.0, \\'wind_degree\\': 17, \\'wind_dir\\': \\'NNE\\', \\'pressure_mb\\': 1026.0, \\'pressure_in\\': 30.31, \\'precip_mm\\': 0.0, \\'precip_in\\': 0.0, \\'humidity\\': 19, \\'cloud\\': 0, \\'feelslike_c\\': 20.6, \\'feelslike_f\\': 69.1, \\'windchill_c\\': 18.1, \\'windchill_f\\': 64.5, \\'heatindex_c\\': 18.3, \\'heatindex_f\\': 65.0, \\'dewpoint_c\\': -11.8, \\'dewpoint_f\\': 10.8, \\'vis_km\\': 16.0, \\'vis_miles\\': 9.0, \\'uv\\': 5.0, \\'gust_mph\\': 3.6, \\'gust_kph\\': 5.9}}\"}, {\"url\": \"https://weatherspark.com/h/m/1705/2024/10/Historical-Weather-in-October-2024-in-Los-Angeles-California-United-States\", \"content\": \"Los Angeles October 2024 Historical Weather Data (California, United States) - Weather Spark October 2024 Weather History in Los Angeles California, United States This report shows the past weather for Los Angeles, providing a weather history for October 2024.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA.

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90\" of snowfall per year. Juneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate.', 'score': 0.6202192, 'raw_content': \"The 10 Most Humid Cities in the U.S., Ranked\\nReading Time:  9 minutes\\nWeather can define a region and its identity. For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Uni√£o da Vit√≥ria is probably about 10 degrees Celsius colder on average than S√£o Paulo. Last winter it was colder than the warmest parts of Antarctica in June!\\nWe‚Äôre talking climate, not weather.\\nhttps://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/weather_climate.html\\nWould be nice to filter by country. I‚Äôm looking at a city in the USA and half the cities with similar climates are other US cities in the same region. I‚Äôm more curious about cities in other countries.\\nthank you for providing this tool for free!!!! very interesting!\\nSydney is nothing like Pueblo Mexico. Completely wrong and arbitrary.\\nIt would be handy if the similar cities were listed by continent, so you could easily see cites far away that have a similar climate. Also the Koppen classification would be nice'}, {'title': 'Find cities with similar climate - Vivid Maps', 'url': 'https://vividmaps.com/find-cities-with-similar-climate/', 'content': 'Comparison of the climate of cities in the world. www.vividmaps.com.

Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere over a short period of time, while Climate refers to the conditions of the atmosphere over a long period of time.\\nWeather, more specifically, refers to how the atmosphere behaves and its effects on life and human activities. Most people think of Weather in terms of what can be observed: temperature, humidity, precipitation, and cloudy/sunny conditions. Weather conditions constantly change on a minute-to-minute basis.\\nClimate is a record of the average weather conditions for a given place over a long period of time, often referred to as Climate Normals.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA. We analyzed data for 251 cities throughout the United States. We used data on the average annual humidity data for mornings, using the most recent 2021 and 2022 data. This annual average data accounts for changes in months and seasons.\\nSam Wasson\\nStaff Writer\\nLearn More\\nLora Novak\\nSenior Editor\\nLearn More\\nBest Moving Labor Services\\nMay 12, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Massachusetts\\nOctober 18, 2024\\nThe Best U.S. Cities for Homeowners in 2022 & 2024\\nNovember 14, 2024\\nHow to Donate Your Used Items to Shelters\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nWhich States Will Pay You to Move There?\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBellhop Moving: An In-Depth Review of Services and Costs\\nNovember 19, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Florida\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n5 Cheap Ways to Ship a Car Cross-Country\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBest International Movers\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\n(251) 478-3345\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\nAdvertiser Disclosure\\nOur editorial team is committed to creating independent and objective content focused on helping our readers make informed decisions.

Juneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate.', 'score': 0.6202192, 'raw_content': \"The 10 Most Humid Cities in the U.S., Ranked\\nReading Time:  9 minutes\\nWeather can define a region and its identity. For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA. We analyzed data for 251 cities throughout the United States. We used data on the average annual humidity data for mornings, using the most recent 2021 and 2022 data. This annual average data accounts for changes in months and seasons.\\nSam Wasson\\nStaff Writer\\nLearn More\\nLora Novak\\nSenior Editor\\nLearn More\\nBest Moving Labor Services\\nMay 12, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Massachusetts\\nOctober 18, 2024\\nThe Best U.S. Cities for Homeowners in 2022 & 2024\\nNovember 14, 2024\\nHow to Donate Your Used Items to Shelters\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nWhich States Will Pay You to Move There?\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBellhop Moving: An In-Depth Review of Services and Costs\\nNovember 19, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Florida\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n5 Cheap Ways to Ship a Car Cross-Country\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBest International Movers\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\n(251) 478-3345\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\nAdvertiser Disclosure\\nOur editorial team is committed to creating independent and objective content focused on helping our readers make informed decisions.

For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Shades of green reflect highly seasonal continental climates ranging from bright green and petrol for cool boreal to warmer chartreuse colored regions; yellow reflects hot and arid conditions; pink reflects hot and wet tropical conditions, and purple represents wet oceanic environments.Alex Egoshin, www.vividmaps.comRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nAlex Egoshin, www.vividmaps.comRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nBest thing about living in North Dakota: Very slim chance of being struck by lightning!\\nI can‚Äôt seem to get to Sydney‚Äôs info üôÅ\\nTrending now\\nRelated Products\\nPush pin maps ¬∑ Globe drinks cabinets ¬∑ Maps of the United States\\xa0¬∑ Board games ¬∑ Monopoly ¬∑ Map-based strategy board games ¬∑ History Board Games ¬∑ Coloring Books ¬∑ Handheld GPS ¬∑ GPS Watches ¬∑ GPS Trackers\\nVivid Maps Tools\\n‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How hot cities could be in 2050‚Äì The U.S. Population Lines‚Äì Convert Latitude/Longitude‚Äì About‚Äì Privacy Policy\\n‚Äì About‚Äì Privacy Policy\\n'}], 'response_time': 3.26}), ToolMessage(content='[{\"url\": \"https://www.weatherapi.com/\", \"content\": \"{\\'location\\': {\\'name\\': \\'Los Angeles\\', \\'region\\': \\'California\\', \\'country\\': \\'United States of America\\', \\'lat\\': 34.0522, \\'lon\\': -118.2428, \\'tz_id\\': \\'America/Los_Angeles\\', \\'localtime_epoch\\': 1733859395, \\'localtime\\': \\'2024-12-10 11:36\\'}, \\'current\\': {\\'last_updated_epoch\\': 1733859000, \\'last_updated\\': \\'2024-12-10 11:30\\', \\'temp_c\\': 20.6, \\'temp_f\\': 69.1, \\'is_day\\': 1, \\'condition\\': {\\'text\\': \\'Sunny\\', \\'icon\\': \\'//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/113.png\\', \\'code\\': 1000}, \\'wind_mph\\': 3.1, \\'wind_kph\\': 5.0, \\'wind_degree\\': 17, \\'wind_dir\\': \\'NNE\\', \\'pressure_mb\\': 1026.0, \\'pressure_in\\': 30.31, \\'precip_mm\\': 0.0, \\'precip_in\\': 0.0, \\'humidity\\': 19, \\'cloud\\': 0, \\'feelslike_c\\': 20.6, \\'feelslike_f\\': 69.1, \\'windchill_c\\': 18.1, \\'windchill_f\\': 64.5, \\'heatindex_c\\': 18.3, \\'heatindex_f\\': 65.0, \\'dewpoint_c\\': -11.8, \\'dewpoint_f\\': 10.8, \\'vis_km\\': 16.0, \\'vis_miles\\': 9.0, \\'uv\\': 5.0, \\'gust_mph\\': 3.6, \\'gust_kph\\': 5.9}}\"}, {\"url\": \"https://weatherspark.com/h/m/1705/2024/10/Historical-Weather-in-October-2024-in-Los-Angeles-California-United-States\", \"content\": \"Los Angeles October 2024 Historical Weather Data (California, United States) - Weather Spark October 2024 Weather History in Los Angeles California, United States This report shows the past weather for Los Angeles, providing a weather history for October 2024.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA.

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90\" of snowfall per year. Juneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate.', 'score': 0.6202192, 'raw_content': \"The 10 Most Humid Cities in the U.S., Ranked\\nReading Time:  9 minutes\\nWeather can define a region and its identity. For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Most people think of Weather in terms of what can be observed: temperature, humidity, precipitation, and cloudy/sunny conditions. Weather conditions constantly change on a minute-to-minute basis.\\nClimate is a record of the average weather conditions for a given place over a long period of time, often referred to as Climate Normals.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA. We analyzed data for 251 cities throughout the United States. We used data on the average annual humidity data for mornings, using the most recent 2021 and 2022 data. This annual average data accounts for changes in months and seasons.\\nSam Wasson\\nStaff Writer\\nLearn More\\nLora Novak\\nSenior Editor\\nLearn More\\nBest Moving Labor Services\\nMay 12, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Massachusetts\\nOctober 18, 2024\\nThe Best U.S. Cities for Homeowners in 2022 & 2024\\nNovember 14, 2024\\nHow to Donate Your Used Items to Shelters\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nWhich States Will Pay You to Move There?\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBellhop Moving: An In-Depth Review of Services and Costs\\nNovember 19, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Florida\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n5 Cheap Ways to Ship a Car Cross-Country\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBest International Movers\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\n(251) 478-3345\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\nAdvertiser Disclosure\\nOur editorial team is committed to creating independent and objective content focused on helping our readers make informed decisions.

For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Shades of green reflect highly seasonal continental climates ranging from bright green and petrol for cool boreal to warmer chartreuse colored regions; yellow reflects hot and arid conditions; pink reflects hot and wet tropical conditions, and purple represents wet oceanic environments.Alex Egoshin, www.vividmaps.comRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nAlex Egoshin, www.vividmaps.comRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nBest thing about living in North Dakota: Very slim chance of being struck by lightning!\\nI can‚Äôt seem to get to Sydney‚Äôs info üôÅ\\nTrending now\\nRelated Products\\nPush pin maps ¬∑ Globe drinks cabinets ¬∑ Maps of the United States\\xa0¬∑ Board games ¬∑ Monopoly ¬∑ Map-based strategy board games ¬∑ History Board Games ¬∑ Coloring Books ¬∑ Handheld GPS ¬∑ GPS Watches ¬∑ GPS Trackers\\nVivid Maps Tools\\n‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How hot cities could be in 2050‚Äì The U.S. Population Lines‚Äì Convert Latitude/Longitude‚Äì About‚Äì Privacy Policy\\n‚Äì About‚Äì Privacy Policy\\n'}], 'response_time': 3.26}), ToolMessage(content='[{\"url\": \"https://www.weatherapi.com/\", \"content\": \"{\\'location\\': {\\'name\\': \\'Los Angeles\\', \\'region\\': \\'California\\', \\'country\\': \\'United States of America\\', \\'lat\\': 34.0522, \\'lon\\': -118.2428, \\'tz_id\\': \\'America/Los_Angeles\\', \\'localtime_epoch\\': 1733859395, \\'localtime\\': \\'2024-12-10 11:36\\'}, \\'current\\': {\\'last_updated_epoch\\': 1733859000, \\'last_updated\\': \\'2024-12-10 11:30\\', \\'temp_c\\': 20.6, \\'temp_f\\': 69.1, \\'is_day\\': 1, \\'condition\\': {\\'text\\': \\'Sunny\\', \\'icon\\': \\'//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/113.png\\', \\'code\\': 1000}, \\'wind_mph\\': 3.1, \\'wind_kph\\': 5.0, \\'wind_degree\\': 17, \\'wind_dir\\': \\'NNE\\', \\'pressure_mb\\': 1026.0, \\'pressure_in\\': 30.31, \\'precip_mm\\': 0.0, \\'precip_in\\': 0.0, \\'humidity\\': 19, \\'cloud\\': 0, \\'feelslike_c\\': 20.6, \\'feelslike_f\\': 69.1, \\'windchill_c\\': 18.1, \\'windchill_f\\': 64.5, \\'heatindex_c\\': 18.3, \\'heatindex_f\\': 65.0, \\'dewpoint_c\\': -11.8, \\'dewpoint_f\\': 10.8, \\'vis_km\\': 16.0, \\'vis_miles\\': 9.0, \\'uv\\': 5.0, \\'gust_mph\\': 3.6, \\'gust_kph\\': 5.9}}\"}, {\"url\": \"https://weatherspark.com/h/m/1705/2024/10/Historical-Weather-in-October-2024-in-Los-Angeles-California-United-States\", \"content\": \"Los Angeles October 2024 Historical Weather Data (California, United States) - Weather Spark October 2024 Weather History in Los Angeles California, United States This report shows the past weather for Los Angeles, providing a weather history for October 2024.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA.

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90\" of snowfall per year. Juneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate.', 'score': 0.6202192, 'raw_content': \"The 10 Most Humid Cities in the U.S., Ranked\\nReading Time:  9 minutes\\nWeather can define a region and its identity. For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Most people think of Weather in terms of what can be observed: temperature, humidity, precipitation, and cloudy/sunny conditions. Weather conditions constantly change on a minute-to-minute basis.\\nClimate is a record of the average weather conditions for a given place over a long period of time, often referred to as Climate Normals.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA. We analyzed data for 251 cities throughout the United States. We used data on the average annual humidity data for mornings, using the most recent 2021 and 2022 data. This annual average data accounts for changes in months and seasons.\\nSam Wasson\\nStaff Writer\\nLearn More\\nLora Novak\\nSenior Editor\\nLearn More\\nBest Moving Labor Services\\nMay 12, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Massachusetts\\nOctober 18, 2024\\nThe Best U.S. Cities for Homeowners in 2022 & 2024\\nNovember 14, 2024\\nHow to Donate Your Used Items to Shelters\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nWhich States Will Pay You to Move There?\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBellhop Moving: An In-Depth Review of Services and Costs\\nNovember 19, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Florida\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n5 Cheap Ways to Ship a Car Cross-Country\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBest International Movers\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\n(251) 478-3345\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\nAdvertiser Disclosure\\nOur editorial team is committed to creating independent and objective content focused on helping our readers make informed decisions.

Juneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate.', 'score': 0.6202192, 'raw_content': \"The 10 Most Humid Cities in the U.S., Ranked\\nReading Time:  9 minutes\\nWeather can define a region and its identity. For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Shades of green reflect highly seasonal continental climates ranging from bright green and petrol for cool boreal to warmer chartreuse colored regions; yellow reflects hot and arid conditions; pink reflects hot and wet tropical conditions, and purple represents wet oceanic environments.Alex Egoshin, www.vividmaps.comRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nAlex Egoshin, www.vividmaps.comRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nRelated posts:‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How global warming will impact 6000+ cities around the world?\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nŒî\\nBest thing about living in North Dakota: Very slim chance of being struck by lightning!\\nI can‚Äôt seem to get to Sydney‚Äôs info üôÅ\\nTrending now\\nRelated Products\\nPush pin maps ¬∑ Globe drinks cabinets ¬∑ Maps of the United States\\xa0¬∑ Board games ¬∑ Monopoly ¬∑ Map-based strategy board games ¬∑ History Board Games ¬∑ Coloring Books ¬∑ Handheld GPS ¬∑ GPS Watches ¬∑ GPS Trackers\\nVivid Maps Tools\\n‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate‚Äì Find cities with a similar climate (2050)‚Äì How hot cities could be in 2050‚Äì The U.S. Population Lines‚Äì Convert Latitude/Longitude‚Äì About‚Äì Privacy Policy\\n‚Äì About‚Äì Privacy Policy\\n'}], 'response_time': 3.26}), ToolMessage(content='[{\"url\": \"https://www.weatherapi.com/\", \"content\": \"{\\'location\\': {\\'name\\': \\'Los Angeles\\', \\'region\\': \\'California\\', \\'country\\': \\'United States of America\\', \\'lat\\': 34.0522, \\'lon\\': -118.2428, \\'tz_id\\': \\'America/Los_Angeles\\', \\'localtime_epoch\\': 1733859395, \\'localtime\\': \\'2024-12-10 11:36\\'}, \\'current\\': {\\'last_updated_epoch\\': 1733859000, \\'last_updated\\': \\'2024-12-10 11:30\\', \\'temp_c\\': 20.6, \\'temp_f\\': 69.1, \\'is_day\\': 1, \\'condition\\': {\\'text\\': \\'Sunny\\', \\'icon\\': \\'//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/113.png\\', \\'code\\': 1000}, \\'wind_mph\\': 3.1, \\'wind_kph\\': 5.0, \\'wind_degree\\': 17, \\'wind_dir\\': \\'NNE\\', \\'pressure_mb\\': 1026.0, \\'pressure_in\\': 30.31, \\'precip_mm\\': 0.0, \\'precip_in\\': 0.0, \\'humidity\\': 19, \\'cloud\\': 0, \\'feelslike_c\\': 20.6, \\'feelslike_f\\': 69.1, \\'windchill_c\\': 18.1, \\'windchill_f\\': 64.5, \\'heatindex_c\\': 18.3, \\'heatindex_f\\': 65.0, \\'dewpoint_c\\': -11.8, \\'dewpoint_f\\': 10.8, \\'vis_km\\': 16.0, \\'vis_miles\\': 9.0, \\'uv\\': 5.0, \\'gust_mph\\': 3.6, \\'gust_kph\\': 5.9}}\"}, {\"url\": \"https://weatherspark.com/h/m/1705/2024/10/Historical-Weather-in-October-2024-in-Los-Angeles-California-United-States\", \"content\": \"Los Angeles October 2024 Historical Weather Data (California, United States) - Weather Spark October 2024 Weather History in Los Angeles California, United States This report shows the past weather for Los Angeles, providing a weather history for October 2024.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA.

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90\" of snowfall per year. Juneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate.', 'score': 0.6202192, 'raw_content': \"The 10 Most Humid Cities in the U.S., Ranked\\nReading Time:  9 minutes\\nWeather can define a region and its identity. For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Most people think of Weather in terms of what can be observed: temperature, humidity, precipitation, and cloudy/sunny conditions. Weather conditions constantly change on a minute-to-minute basis.\\nClimate is a record of the average weather conditions for a given place over a long period of time, often referred to as Climate Normals.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA. We analyzed data for 251 cities throughout the United States. We used data on the average annual humidity data for mornings, using the most recent 2021 and 2022 data. This annual average data accounts for changes in months and seasons.\\nSam Wasson\\nStaff Writer\\nLearn More\\nLora Novak\\nSenior Editor\\nLearn More\\nBest Moving Labor Services\\nMay 12, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Massachusetts\\nOctober 18, 2024\\nThe Best U.S. Cities for Homeowners in 2022 & 2024\\nNovember 14, 2024\\nHow to Donate Your Used Items to Shelters\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nWhich States Will Pay You to Move There?\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBellhop Moving: An In-Depth Review of Services and Costs\\nNovember 19, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Florida\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n5 Cheap Ways to Ship a Car Cross-Country\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBest International Movers\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\n(251) 478-3345\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\nAdvertiser Disclosure\\nOur editorial team is committed to creating independent and objective content focused on helping our readers make informed decisions.

Juneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate.', 'score': 0.6202192, 'raw_content': \"The 10 Most Humid Cities in the U.S., Ranked\\nReading Time:  9 minutes\\nWeather can define a region and its identity. For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.

Housing prices, local economy, and distance to friends and family all play considerable roles in your decision. However, weather and regional humidity are two aspects of a location you should never overlook. If you‚Äôve never lived in a city with extreme humidity, it can be a jarring experience.\\nHumidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor within the air. There are\\xa0several kinds of humidity, such as absolute and specific, but relative humidity is the most common, often referenced in weather reports. This humidity measurement tracks the current level of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the current temperature can hold. Air can only hold so much moisture depending on its current temperature, so if it is 86¬∞F outside, it can only hold about 30 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.\\nTo help you make the best possible decision for your next relocation, we here at Today‚Äôs Homeowner conducted a study that looked at the most and least humid cities in the U.S. This article sheds light on our findings and briefly discusses some of the major impacts humidity can have on your home.\\nMain Findings From Our Research\\nThe top five most humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nThe five least humid cities in the U.S. are:\\nAverage Humidity By City\\nWe gathered comprehensive data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the humidity of each city in the U.S. We then compiled this information to find the average annual humidity. We could rank each city from there, finding the most humid to the least humid. Below we will present each end of the spectrum, followed by the complete list of all analyzed cities.\\nCities With the Highest Humidity\\nIn the top five, we have Lake Charles, LA, Jackson, MS, Meridian, MS, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, all at 90% humidity. While Lake Charles, Jackson, and Meridian were not a big surprise, Port Arthur and Brownsville were more unexpected. Most people picture large pastures and arid deserts when they envision Texas. However, Texas is still a coastal state in the Gulf of Mexico with plenty of port cities.\\nBeyond the top five, we have Victoria, TX (90%), Gainesville, FL (89%), Baton Rouge, LA (89%), Corpus Christi, TX (89%), and Houston, TX (89%). Again, we see that Texas holds the most spots, comprising five of the top 10, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi, tied for second place. It should be no surprise that all states in the top 10 have been within the Gulf of Mexico. Jackson is the most inland city on this list, but its humidity is explained by its proximity to the state‚Äôs massive inland swamps and bogs.\\nThe final five most humid cities on our list are Quillayute, WA (89%), St. Paul Island, AK (88%), Fort Myers, FL (88%), Jacksonville, FL (88%), and Orlando, FL (88%). This final set of cities threw a few curve balls, most notably St. Paul. We would have never guessed a small island in Alaska would rank in the top 15 most humid cities. The city of St. Paul rests on an island of the same name, located in the Bering Sea between Mainland Alaska and Russia. The island is cold, with temperatures ranging from minus 26¬∞F to 66¬∞F, with an average of around 32¬∞F. Due to the island‚Äôs high winds, small size, and the surrounding water, even at its frigid temperatures, it possesses high humidity.\\nOur data shows that the most humid cities are those along the country‚Äôs southern border. While there are some exceptions, mainly Washington and Alaska, it‚Äôs important to remember that you don‚Äôt always need high heat to have high humidity. While heat is a major factor in producing humid climates, a location with enough rainfall (like Washington state) or a location exposed to high winds along large bodies of water (such as St. Paul) can produce humidity.\\nCities With the Lowest Humidity\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to avoid humidity, you might want to consider cities located in the Central or Western portions of the United States. The top five least humid cities are Las Vegas, NV (36%), Bishop, CA (38%), Phoenix, AZ (46%), Tucson, AZ (47%), and El Paso, TX (50%). This data shows the true diversity of some states‚Äô ecosystems and environments. While California is a coastal state, Bishop lies far inland, on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, resting along the border of Nevada. We also have El Paso, showing Texas contains both the most and least humid cities in the U.S. While Texas does possess great humidity along its coast, it contains arid deserts, where El Paso lies. Specifically, El Paso rests in Texas‚Äôs northwestern corner, along the border of Mexico and New Mexico.\\nThe next five driest cities are Denver, CO (50%), Blue Canyon, CA (51%), Winslow, AZ (52%), Albuquerque, NM (53%), and Grand Junction, CO (56%). With this next set of cities, Colorado ties with New Mexico and California, each holding two spots, respectively.\\nThe last set of least humid cities in the U.S. follow suit to the first 10, including mostly central desert states. The final five include Roswell, NM (58%), Colorado Springs, CO (58%), Los Angeles, CA (58%), Lander, WY (60%), and Winnemucca, NV (60%). Unsurprisingly, Arizona holds the most spots in the top 10 driest cities, with a total of three. Behind Arizona, we have Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, all tied for second place with two entries a piece.\\nWhile coastlines create the most humidity, we can see that deserts create the least. If you‚Äôre looking for arid locations, your best bet is heading to the Central states. Or you can try locations like Texas or California, whose diversity of climates can allow you to experience both extremes with a quick car ride across the state.\\nFull Dataset: The Most & Least Humid Cities Ranked\\nThe following table shows the results of our study, presented in the form of a sortable table.\\xa0 You can navigate the pages to see different cities and sort the table by rank, city name, or average annual humidity.\\nAnalyzing Our Study Results\\nThe results of our study came with plenty of surprises. For example, most homeowners would not suspect a city on an island just off Alaska to be one of the most humid in the U.S. It also shows that many states, particularly those along a coastline, like\\xa0California\\xa0and\\xa0Texas, can have both extremely arid and humid cities. \\nOverall, if you‚Äôre looking for a humid location like California to move to and live in, you‚Äôll want to move to a location along the Southeastern portion of the U.S. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt stand humidity and want something much dryer, you‚Äôre best suited to move inland, aiming for western states like Arizona or\\xa0Colorado.\\nFAQs About the Most and Least Humid Cities\\n\\n                        What areas in the U.S. are most humid?                    \\nThe most humid location in the U.S. is the Southeastern Coastal Plain along the Gulf of Mexico. Other locations, specifically along the Northwest Coast, also have high humidity.\\n\\n                        Is humidity worse in Texas or Florida?                    \\nIt depends on how you want to look at it. Texas holds five spots in the top 10 most humid cities, while\\xa0Florida\\xa0only holds one, so Texas possesses more cities with extreme humidity. But, if you look further out to the top 20 or 30 cities, Florida has more overall entries than Texas. So, Florida has more locations with high humidity, but Texas has the most locations with the highest intensity of humidity.\\n\\n                        Where is the most humid place to live?                    \\nThe most humid city in the United States is Lake Charles, LA. But, Jackson, MI, Meridian, MI, Brownsville, TX, and Port Arthur, TX, also have humidity that rivals Lake Charles.\\n\\n                        Does humidity affect mold growth?                    \\nMold requires\\xa0water to grow and spread. Areas with higher humidity allow mold to grow more quickly and effectively.\\nMethodology\\nTo find the most and least humid cities, we analyzed weather data from the\\xa0NOAA. We analyzed data for 251 cities throughout the United States. We used data on the average annual humidity data for mornings, using the most recent 2021 and 2022 data. This annual average data accounts for changes in months and seasons.\\nSam Wasson\\nStaff Writer\\nLearn More\\nLora Novak\\nSenior Editor\\nLearn More\\nBest Moving Labor Services\\nMay 12, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Massachusetts\\nOctober 18, 2024\\nThe Best U.S. Cities for Homeowners in 2022 & 2024\\nNovember 14, 2024\\nHow to Donate Your Used Items to Shelters\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nWhich States Will Pay You to Move There?\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBellhop Moving: An In-Depth Review of Services and Costs\\nNovember 19, 2024\\nTop 5 Best Moving Companies in Florida\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n5 Cheap Ways to Ship a Car Cross-Country\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nBest International Movers\\nOctober 18, 2024\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\n75 Midtown Park E, Mobile, Alabama, 36606, United States\\n(251) 478-3345\\nhello@todayshomeowner.com\\nAdvertiser Disclosure\\nOur editorial team is committed to creating independent and objective content focused on helping our readers make informed decisions.

For example, Pacific Northwest cities like Seattle, WA are known for their clouds and rain, whereas desert cities such as Phoenix, AZ are dry and clear for most of the year.\\xa0\\nHowever, an often-overlooked aspect of weather is humidity. Humidity plays an important role in influencing how hot the temperature actually feels (the heat index); high heat plus high humidity can be very dangerous. People living in the southeastern U.S. know how much humidity can affect daily life.\\xa0\\nWhen deciding where to live, understanding how your body adapts to humidity is key. Many people prefer the feeling of dry heat, while others don‚Äôt mind the heavier air that comes with high humidity. So, if you‚Äôre planning to move somewhere new, read on to discover the most humid cities in the U.S. and see if they‚Äôre right for you.\\xa0\\nHow we define humidity\\nBefore we dive into the most humid cities, let‚Äôs define what humidity is. There are generally three ways to measure humidity: relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew point.\\xa0\\nThis list focuses on the first category, relative humidity. Relative humidity is the most common way people think and talk about humidity and how ‚Äúmuggy‚Äù the air feels. Relative humidity is higher when the air temperature is lower and lower when air temperature is higher. As such, we‚Äôll also mention average annual temperature.\\nWe‚Äôll also mention dew points when possible; they measure the actual moisture in the air, unlike relative humidity, which shows how saturated the air is at a given temperature. For instance, a 35¬∞F day with a 35¬∞F dew point produces 100% relative humidity, but the air won‚Äôt feel very humid due to the low water content. In contrast, a 90¬∞F day with a 70¬∞F dew point results in only 52% relative humidity but feels much stickier. Higher dew points always feel more humid.\\xa0\\nKeep reading to see our ranking of the most humid cities with over 20,000 residents based on their average annual relative humidity. Afterwards, we‚Äôll briefly list the least humid cities.\\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding between renting or buying  your next home?

Juneau is also one of the coldest cities in the country and sees ~90‚Äù of snowfall per year.\\xa0\\nJuneau is so humid because of its coastal location and cold climate. Colder air can hold less water, after all. Temperatures rarely surpass 65¬∞F, and precipitation from the active Northern Pacific is common year-round ‚Äì more than 250 days during a wet year. Luckily, since temperatures are cool, dew points are also low, so it rarely feels very humid.\\xa0\\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the area, you‚Äôll love the glacier-filled landscapes, small-town feel, indigenous culture, and rich history. Plus, lively residents will more than make up for the gloomy weather.\\xa0\\nJuneau homes for sale | Juneau houses for rent | Juneau apartments for rent\\n \\nBring the holidays home with\\nRedfin Redesign\\n2. San Francisco, California\\nSan Francisco is the second-most humid city in the United States. Known for its cool, foggy summers, SF is truly a maritime town influenced by the sea. Rainfall is less common than you might expect, but a consistent onshore flow means the air is generally very damp.\\xa0\\nInfrequently, drier offshore wind (from the mainland) blows in and creates hot, brittle, sunny conditions. This weather pattern is conducive to wildfires and is becoming more common throughout the Bay Area. However, this is rare enough that it hardly brings down the region‚Äôs high average humidity.\\xa0\\nSF is known for its tech industry and culture, historic landmarks, massive parks, and beautiful vistas, making it a one-of-a-kind place to call home. There are truly an endless amount of things to do. The city is among the most expensive in the nation, though.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco homes for sale | San Francisco houses for rent | San Francisco apartments for rent\\n\\n3. Port Arthur, Texas\\nJust an hour and a half east of Houston, Port Arthur is a small Texas city known for its oil industry, cajun cooking, and outdoor recreation. The city sits on Sabine Lake just across from the Louisiana border.\\nThe combination of heat and humidity becomes a problem in the south. Port Arthur gets its moisture from the warm waters of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, which can create extremely muggy weather. This is because warmer air can hold more water, translating to higher dew points and creating a very humid-feeling climate. Winters are generally mild and pleasant, but summers are hot and suffocating.\\xa0\\nDry air sometimes flows in, which can help with humidity but often leads to hotter temperatures. Severe weather is also very common in the region, with hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flooding all possible\\xa0\\nPort Arthur homes for sale | Port Arthur houses for rent | Port Arthur apartments for rent\\n\\n4. Lake Charles, Louisiana\\nLake Charles is the fourth-most humid city in the nation. As another southern city on the Gulf Coast, stormy weather, heavy rain, and flooding are again common. Lake Charles is only an hour from Port Arthur, so they have very similar climates.\\nLake Charles is known for its casinos, oil refineries, and beaches. Plus, the area‚Äôs cost of living is very low, so if you can handle hot, humid weather for six months of the year, you could consider moving.\\xa0\\nLake Charles homes for sale | Lake Charles houses for rent | Lake Charles apartments for rent\\n \\n5. Galveston, Texas\\nGalveston, an oil-rich city on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, comes in at number five on our list. Galveston sits along the low-lying barrier islands an hour from Houston. 32 miles of shoreline, the famous Moody Gardens, iconic Galveston Pier, and nostalgic Historic District are a few highlights. \\nGalveston‚Äôs humidity comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which also provides plenty of moisture for periodic, heavy rainfall and hot, damp summers. Recently, Galveston saw its hottest August on record, capping off a two-month long heat wave and months of prolonged drought. The heat index regularly surpasses 100¬∞F, sometimes remaining there for over a day due to the humid air.\\nGalveston homes for sale | Galveston houses for rent | Galveston apartments for rent\\n \\n6. Olympia, Washington\\nThe capital of Washington State and home to the Evergreen State College Geoducks, Olympia is the sixth-most humid city in the country. Olympia is known for its slower pace of life, outdoor recreation, breweries, and many annual events.\\nSimilar to Juneau, Olympia is so humid because of its coastal location and mild climate. It‚Äôs generally rainy and gloomy for over half the year, although snow is rare. Summers are mild and sunny. The city only gets hot a few times a year, but when it does, it can feel oppressive. Heat waves have become more common in recent years.\\xa0\\nOlympia homes for sale | Olympia houses for rent | Olympia apartments for rent\\n \\n7. Brownsville, Texas\\nLocated on the warm Gulf Coast only a few hundred miles from the Chihuahuan Desert, Brownsville experiences both hot desert heat and warm coastal humidity. These factors help the city see extremely hot summers and generally warm temperatures year-round. The Rio Grande Valley as a whole is very hot.\\xa0\\nLike most of Texas, 2023 was exceptionally hot. 2024 brought heat waves that pushed the heat index near 130¬∞F, with high humidity keeping overnight heat indices above 75¬∞F, which is uncomfortable.\\xa0\\nBrownsville is home to gorgeous beaches, wildlife viewing areas, and walkable state parks. The cost of living is affordable, too.\\xa0\\nBrownsville homes for sale | Brownsville houses for rent | Brownsville apartments for rent\\n \\n8. Corpus Christi, Texas\\nCorpus Christi is another hot Texas city nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. Like other cities along the Gulf, heat and humidity can combine to create dangerously warm conditions. During the months-long 2023 heat wave, Corpus Christi logged a heat index of 125¬∞F ‚Äì a record high. The number of 100-degree days in Texas is projected to double by 2036 compared to what it was between 2001 and 2020.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi is a small, oil-rich city but has plenty going for it. Residents love taking trips to the nearby Padre or Mustang Islands and feeling the warm, salty breeze. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy kayaking in the Laguna Madre and fishing for fresh seafood, or spending a night out at one of the many restaurants in town.\\xa0\\nCorpus Christi homes for sale | Corpus Christi houses for rent | Corpus Christi apartments for rent\\n \\n9. New Orleans, Louisiana\\nThe jewel of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans is built along the crescent-shaped banks of the Mississippi River. Just north of the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are slightly cooler than South Texas cities, but very high humidity can still make conditions dangerously hot. Temperatures rarely surpass 100¬∞F, but when they do, the heat index can soar past 110¬∞F.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans has a lot going for it. It‚Äôs known for its lively French Quarter, charming Garden District, and miles of scenic bayous. It also boasts world-class music, Creole cuisine, and famous festivals like Mardi Gras that draw millions to the city every year.\\xa0\\nNew Orleans homes for sale | New Orleans houses for rent | New Orleans apartments for rent\\n \\n10. Victoria, Texas\\nVictoria is situated in the Golden Crescent of Texas between Corpus Christi and Galveston, about an hour from the Gulf of Mexico. Hunting, fishing, and exploring the outdoors are some of the most popular things to do. You‚Äôll find plenty of farms, historic buildings, and arts opportunities, too. The region is also famous for its oil, but production has steeply dropped over the past 30 years.\\xa0\\nVictoria‚Äôs humidity and heat come from the nearby Gulf, but heat waves can push temperatures a bit higher than cities on the water due to its more inland location.\\xa0\\nVictoria homes for sale | Victoria houses for rent | Victoria apartments for rent\\nThe 10 least humid cities in the U.S.\\nMany people enjoy drier weather, especially in the summer. If this is you, here‚Äôs a list of the least humid U.S. cities based on average annual relative humidity:\\nWhat is the most humid place in the country?\\nThe outright most humid place in the U.S. is St. Paul, Alaska. St. Paul has an average annual humidity of 86% ‚Äì topping out at 93% in July. Most mornings have readings well above 80%. St. Paul is the primary settlement of Saint Paul Island, which is one of the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of Alaska. Cold Bay, located among the Aleutian Islands to the south, is the second most-humid at 83.5%. However, they‚Äôre much too small to make our list.\\xa0\\nSt. Paul is so humid because it lies in the middle of the ocean, is far from the mainland, and is cold year-round. Colder air holds less moisture, so even a small amount of water vapor can saturate the air and push up relative humidity. Low temperatures also mean low dew points, though, so thankfully the town generally doesn‚Äôt feel very humid.\\nHow is humidity changing?\\nThe world has been heating up rapidly. Ending this past July, there were 14 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, and 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record. This warmth has had devastating consequences over the past year and a half in the form of heat waves, flooding, drought, and more.\\xa0\\nHumidity is also expected to rise as climate change continues because warmer air can hold more water. Warmer, more humid air leads to extremely high heat indices, which can become deadly to humans. Heat index extremes are increasing several times faster than air temperatures, too.\\xa0\\nThe highest heat index in the U.S. reportedly occurred in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1995, when it reached 148¬∞F. Notoriously hot cities like Phoenix are too dry to generate extreme heat indices. The highest heat indices in the world have occurred near the Persian Gulf, including in Iran (180¬∞F) and Saudi Arabia (178¬∞F).\\xa0\\nAs global warming accelerates, research indicates that rising humidity, paired with higher temperatures, will make many locations increasingly uncomfortable and even uninhabitable by 2100. Nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs population is exposed to deadly heat today. Without intervention, that share will rise to nearly 50%. Cities closer to the equator are home to the highest number of people at risk of deadly heat.\\xa0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse hunting made easy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMethodology\\nThis list contains annual relative humidity data for cities with over 20,000 residents. A city‚Äôs annual average was calculated by averaging the annual morning and afternoon humidity averages into a single number. Comparative Climatic Data was obtained from a 2023 review by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and its parent administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\n \\nJamie is part of the Content Marketing team at Redfin and has spent 2+ years writing about climate change, housing affordability, and the housing market.

Whether you are looking for a place to live permanently, or just a destination to visit, knowing the weather patterns of a city can help you plan your activities and prepare for any unexpected weather events. By finding cities with similar weather conditions, you can ensure that you will feel comfortable and enjoy your time in that location.\\nStep 1: Identify your current city‚Äôs weather\\nThe first step in finding cities with similar weather conditions is to identify the weather patterns of your current city. Take note of the temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns. Keep track of any extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, or blizzards. This information will serve as a baseline for finding cities that share similar weather patterns.\\nStep 2: Determine key weather characteristics\\nOnce you have identified your current city‚Äôs weather patterns, determine which characteristics are most important to you. Is it the temperature, amount of rainfall, or humidity? Are you looking for a city with mild weather year-round, or do you prefer distinct seasons? Knowing which weather characteristics are most important to you will help you narrow down your search for cities with similar weather.\\nStep 3: Research cities with similar weather\\nAfter determining your ideal weather conditions, conduct research on cities that share similar weather patterns. Look for cities in the same region or hemisphere as your current location. Weather patterns can vary greatly depending on location, so it is important to find cities with a similar geographical position.\\nStep 4: Use online climate databases\\nOnline climate databases such as Weatherbase or Climate-Data.org can provide valuable information on a city‚Äôs weather patterns. These databases offer data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more. They can also provide rankings of cities based on weather conditions, which can help you narrow down your search.\\nStep 5: Consider regional climate patterns\\nRegional climate patterns can affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. For example, cities located near oceans or large bodies of water tend to have milder temperatures and higher humidity levels. On the other hand, cities located inland or in mountainous regions tend to have more extreme temperature fluctuations. Consider these regional climate patterns when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 6: Look beyond temperature and precipitation\\nWhile temperature and precipitation are important weather characteristics, it is also important to consider other factors such as humidity, wind patterns, and air quality. These factors can greatly affect your comfort level and overall health in a given location.\\nStep 7: Consider altitude and latitude\\nAltitude and latitude can also affect a city‚Äôs weather conditions. Cities located at higher altitudes tend to have cooler temperatures, while cities located closer to the equator tend to have warmer temperatures year-round. Consider these factors when looking for cities with similar weather conditions.\\nStep 8: Look for cities with similar vegetation\\nCities with similar vegetation can also have similar weather patterns. For example, cities with lush forests tend to have higher humidity levels and more rainfall, while cities located in arid regions tend to have lower humidity levels and less rainfall.\\nStep 9: Consult with a meteorologist\\nConsulting with a meteorologist can provide valuable insight into a city‚Äôs weather patterns. A meteorologist can provide information on extreme weather events, weather patterns throughout the year, and any potential climate risks in a given location.\\nStep 10: Visit potential cities before moving\\nBefore making a final decision, it is important to visit potential cities and experience the weather conditions firsthand. This will give you a better understanding of what it is like to live in that location and whether or not it is a good fit for you.\\nConclusion: Finding your ideal climate\\nBy following these steps, you can find cities with similar weather conditions and narrow down your search for your ideal climate. Remember to consider all factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, regional climate patterns, altitude, latitude, vegetation, and air quality. Consulting with a meteorologist and visiting potential cities before making a decision can also provide valuable insight.\\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\\nComment\\n \\n\\n\\nTravel Inspiration\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions & Things to Do in Dubai\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in the Seychelles\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Hungary\\nTop-Rated Tourist Attractions in Italy\\nMost Beautiful Islands in the South Pacific\\nRecent posts\\nTop-Rated Attractions & Things to Do in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, ID\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Coos Bay, OR\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Wenatchee, WA\\nTop-Rated Things to Do in Sleepy Hollow, NY\\nTravelAsker\\nYour essential travel companion.
